Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the
majority of new cancer cases and cancer related deaths according to global statistics, making it a
significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society.
The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance ofsurvivalsignificantly, as it can
promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can
prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and
classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because
of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning
(ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast
modelling.Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially
in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.
